Your main task for this lab is to create key words for a piece of
text. More precisely, given the name of a text file, we want to store
the words that occur in the file along with their frequency (number of
occurrences).

We want to be able to perform the following operations on these collections
of key words:
- Find the "top n" words, meaning the words that occur with the top n frequencies.
- Compare one collection to another, to remove from both collections every
  word they have in common.
