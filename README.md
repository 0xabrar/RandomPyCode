RandomPyCode
============

This is a repository used to keep track of small random Python code which is 
being written while learning the Python language.

Blips:
Small tiny pieces of codes which aren't very relevant but may have aided in lerning a fundamental process which has shown to be incredibly useful for myself in Python (i.e. list comprehensions). 

CS1:
Micihigan State University has small problems to solve for beginner Python students.The problems are available here: http://www.cse.msu.edu/~cse231/PracticeOfComputingUsingPython/

This section includes my own solutions to the problems.

Labs:
Labs completed during the tutorial section of the course CSC148 at the University of Toronto. These labs are normally participation based. Full instructions are included in a pdf in the folder.
